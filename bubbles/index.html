            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>A Labyrinth was an alternate reality game developed by the University of Chicago during the COVID-19 pandemic. It took place between April and May of 2020, inviting approximately 3,500 players to form 73 teams and engage with a digital space for imaginative creation. Teams competed by tackling quests across diverse categories such as making, connecting, moving, performing, solving, worldbuilding, and researching.</p>

          <div id="alabyrinth-text-2">
            <h2>Progress</h2>
            <p>Through practice and iterative work, I was able to more closely follow my colleagues' aesthetic. Adaptability only became increasingly important as different quests required us to come up with clever designs to convey the quest content without straying too far from the art style.</p>

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <p>After a couple of weeks on the team, I become more confident with my design ability and took much less time to progress from ideation and concept to finished product. Our seamless team communication also allowed us to divide work and share deliverables in real time; an essential quality for maximizing productivity on a remote team.</p>

          <p>Golden Ties is a short 2D platformer video game made for the Global Game Jam hackathon over the course of 72 hours. I worked with a team of 5 other undergraduate students to make it, focusing mainly on asset design with some involvement in narrative development. Our team consisted of talented programmers, graphic designers, and even a musician. We were each stepping out of our comfort zones in making a video game, but were eager to put together our diverse skills and try our hands at a medium close to our hearts.</p>

          <h2 style="text-align: center">:o</h2>
          <p>I worked mostly on art assets for the game alongside our other graphic designer. I made most of the discrete objects in the game and some of the background tiles, while our other graphic designer took charge of character designs and many of the scene tiles.</p>

          <p>This project was my first experience with pixel art, a style of game art which presents the challenge of not only representing real-life objects with limited pixels but also thinking with historical conventions of pixel art in other video games to embed associative meaning into visual assets.</p>
