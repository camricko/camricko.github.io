# Introduction

This project explores interactive bubbles as an alternative to vertical and horizontal ribbon menus. In this web app, sets of similarly-colored "bubbles" act as paths to information, waiting for the user to hover over them and discover new content. My goal with this project, a product of playfulness, is just to imagine more engaging ways to interact with a static, information-based webpage.

Human-webpage interactions don't necessarily have to be strictly sorted, organized, and optimized like databases. Take a moment to just _sit_ in this webpage and enjoy the colored bubbles. It'll change with you, both when you interact with it and when you don't.

Aesthetic inspiration for this project was taken from _Osu!_, a PC rhythmn game I'm fond of. Conceptual inspiration was taken in good part from Benjamin Lee Whorf's "The Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to Language" which compares, among other things, how time and its passage is baked into language.

This project was first developed for a class on Embodied Data and Gamified Interfaces at the University of Chicago, instructed by Jon Chambers. I worked on it further in my senior year capstone class with Jon Satrom. I am indebted to both of them for helping me get this project working.
