# Is this how you make one of these?

This project explores an alternative to vertical and horizontal ribbons for making menus. Dropdown menus, in particular, are common forms for organizing hyperlinks to different pages. But what if we stepped back from that format as a given? What if we had a website where, instead of navigating procedurally, everything we could possibly explore were already on the page in front of us?

Here I experiment with using raindrop-like objects on the screen to act as paths to information, and hopefully create an experience that's at least in some ways more engaging than a typical website.
Human-computer interactions don't have to be sorted like datasets or organized in such a way as to maximize time and efficiency. Take a moment to just _sit_ in this webpage. It'll change with you, both when you interact with it and when you don't.

Aesthetic inspiration for this project was taken from _Osu!_, a PC rhythmn game about clicking circles, and conceptual inspiration came in good part from Benjamin Lee Whorf's "The Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to Language," where Whorf compares, among other things,the conception of time in European languages/cultures with those of the Native American Hopi people. Credits also to Anna Tsing's _The Mushroom at the End of the World_ for striking impressions on working with the ruins in front of us and adapting to precarity.

This project was first developed for a class on Embodied Data and Gamified Interfaces at the University of Chicago, instructed by Jon Chambers.
